. dynamic stack size

. paging (p.37)
	. xv6 lacks:
		. demand paging from disk?
		. copy-on-write fork
		. shared memory?
		. lazily-allocated page
		. automatically extending stacks

	. exercises:
		. Modify xv6 so that the pages for the kernel are shared
		  among processes, which reduces memory consumption ?

. Does xv6 "page in/out" pages from disk when short on memory?
  Or does it assume infinite memory...

. single processor
	. create branch where code related to multiprocessor omitted
	. ensure works...

. What changes did DoctorWkt make to kernel?


. DMA (p.49)
	. High-bandwidth devices (disks, graphics, network) use DMA instead
	  of explicit IO instructions (in/out)
	. DMA allows the device to directly access physical memory
	. The respective driver gives the device the physical address of
	  the data, and the device copies it directly from main memory,
	  interrupting once the copy is complete...
	. I.e. the CPU is not involved in the transfer (it does not send out
	  individual data bytes from memory to the device)


. FAT mount...
