/* Major vs minor device number
     . https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/linux-device-drivers/0596000081/ch03s02.html
     . The major number identifies the driver associated with
       the device. For example, /dev/null and /dev/zero are both
       managed by the same driver.
     . The minor number is used only by the driver. Other parts
       of the kernel donâ€™t use it, and merely pass it along to
       the driver. It is common for a driver to control several
       devices. The minor number provides a way for the driver
       to differentiate among them.
