Project 2

	Adding features to shell
		. http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs537-3/Projects/p2a.html

		. echo hello
		. echo hello > out.txt   // overwrite redirect, uses dup...
		. echo hello >> out.txt  // append '''
		. echo hello | wc        // redirect out to in of another, uses pipe...

		. Also add directories to mkfs.c
			. consider that in xv6 can:
				. mkdir abc
				. cd abc
				. echo hello | out.txt

		. Add O_TRUNC and O_APPEND to open, so that > and >> work in shell
