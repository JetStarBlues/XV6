Project 3

	Part A
		. http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs537-3/Projects/p3a.html

		. Implement memory allocator for the heap of a user-level process
			. malloc()
			. free()
		. alloc steps:
			. 1) ask OS to expand heap portion of process's address space
			     by calling 'sbrk' or 'mmap'
			. 2) dole out memory to the calling process. This involves
			     managing a free list of memory and finding a contiguous
			     chunk that is large enough for the user's request.
		. free steps:
			. 1) add chunk back to list

	Part B
		. http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cs537-3/Projects/p3a.html

		. Change stack location from:

			code
			stack (fixed size, one page)
			heap (grows towards high end of address space)

		. to:

			code
			heap (grows towards high end of address space)
			...
			stack (grows towards low end of address space)
