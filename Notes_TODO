. lseek

. dynamic stack size

. paging (p.37)
	. xv6 lacks:
		. demand paging from disk?
		. copy-on-write fork
		. shared memory?
		. lazily-allocated page
		. automatically extending stacks

. Does xv6 "page in/out" pages from disk when short on memory?
  Or does it assume infinite memory...

. single processor
	. create branch where code related to multiprocessor omitted
	. ensure works...
